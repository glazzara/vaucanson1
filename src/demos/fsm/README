	This demo is meant to generate tool-boxes "à la" FSM [1] from
	a configuration file toolbox.hh that defines what kind of
	automaton the user wants to manipulate.

	The generated files can be used to benchmark Vaucanson in
	comparison with fsm when it is instantiated with different
	implementation.

USAGE
-----
	1. create a directory (say "automaton_t") ;
	
	2. create toolbox.hh and toolbox.cc into it. These files must
	define a type "automaton_t" which is the type of automaton and
	a function "series" which returns the series that are
	used in the toolbox. (for example, look at the distributed
	"usual_automaton_t/toolbox.[hh,cc]")

	3. use the "./generate_toolbox.sh" script to generate the
	toolbox files, like this:
	
		./generate_toolbox.sh the_directory_of_1

	4. in the directory, use the classical:

		autoreconf
		CPPFLAGS="-I your_vaucanson_include_dir" ./configure
		make
