	This demo is meant to generate tool-boxes "à la" FSM [1] from
	a configuration file toolbox.hh that defines what kind of
	automaton the user wants to manipulate.

	The generated files can be used to benchmark Vaucanson in
	comparison with fsm when it is instantiated with different
	implementation.
