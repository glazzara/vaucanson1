Making a release
================

Don't do these steps from memory.

  - Make sure the last run of the autobuilder was successful.
  - Check trac to make sure there are no important pending tickets.

  - Update ``doc/share/`` with ``cd doc; make share-up``.

  - Make sure ``doc/NEWS.txt`` is up-to-date.
    (Mention important known bugs!)
  - Make sure ``doc/README.txt`` is up-to-date.
  - Make sure ``doc/FAQ.txt`` is up-to-date.

  - Make sure AUTHORS is up-to-date.

Make sure your system has up-to-date tools (Autotools, Swig, Doxygen,
...)  before continuing.

  - Bump the version number in ``configure.ac``.
  - Run ``bootstrap``.
  - Write the ``ChangeLog`` entry for all the above changes
    (But don't commit it before ``distcheck``.)

  - Run ``make distcheck``.
  - Commit all changes on success.  Commit suicide otherwise.
  - Tag the repository for the release.

  - Append a ``a`` to the version number in ``configure.ac`` and commit
    this new change so that the next run of the autobuilder won't
    create a release.

  - Copy the files created by ``distcheck`` to ``/lrde/dload/vaucanson/``
  - Create the release page on the LRDE wiki
  - Update the Vaucanson page to point to it

  - Send an announcement to vaucanson@lrde.epita.fr

  - Install the new version on ``vcsn.enst.fr``.

  - Complete and detail this list with what was missing (whatever will
    help the next guy doing the release).


Template arguments naming convention
====================================

Template arguments:

  - A  : Automaton structure.
  - AI : Automaton implementation.
  - S  : Series.
  - SI : Series implementation.
  - W  : a Word.

In the case where multiple possibilities could be used, suffix the
template argument with the appropriate numbering. For example, to
enable the use of two different automaton implementations for each
argument of an algorithm::

  template <typename A, typename AI1, typename AI2>
  Element<A, AI1>
  algorithm(const Element<A, AI1>& a1, const Element<A, AI2>& a2>);
