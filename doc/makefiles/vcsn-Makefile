# This Makefile can be used to develop a standalone program in
# Vaucanson. It uses a trick to enhance the compilation speed (you can
# gain a factor 5).  The trick is based on the fact that Vaucanson
# does not have to be analysed and instanciated at each modifications
# of your code.  During the first compilation, Vaucanson's code is
# collected in a compilation unit. In the next compilation, only the
# interface of Vaucanson will be used on the condition that no new
# Vaucanson code is instanciated. Otherwise, the system must collect
# the new code i.e.  it must recompile the two compilation units.

# System options.

          # compliance).
