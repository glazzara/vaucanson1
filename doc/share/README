All the files in this directory (except this README) are maintained in
  https://svn.lrde.epita.fr/svn/lrde-publis/trunk/share/

You can update them by running "make share-up" in the doc/ directory.

Do not modify these files directly or your changes will be lost
the next time someone runs "make share-up".  If you need to fix
something, fix it in the aforementioned SVN repository.
