\label{sec:fmp-fct}

Automata over a product of (two) free monoids are called 
\emph{transducers} in the literature and 
\index{transducer}
\code{fmp-transducers} in \vcsn,  
`\code{fmp}' stands for \emph{free monoid product}.
Their behaviours are series over~$\Ae\x\Be$, \ie weighted subsets 
of~$\Ae\x\Be$, or weighted relations from~$\Ae$ (input monoid) 
to~$\Be$ (output monoid), but looked at symmetrically. 

Transducers can also be considered as automata over the input 
alphabet with multiplicity in the semiring of (rational) series over 
the output alphabet (the equivalence between the two points of view 
is asserted by the Kleene-Sch\"utzenberger theorem).
These would be called \code{rw-transducers} in \vcsn,  
`\code{rw}' stands for \emph{rational weights}. 
They are not 
implemented in \tafkitv (\cf \sbsct{taf-ins}) but
will be in subsequent versions.

In the sequel, we denote the input monoid by~$\Ae$, the output monoid 
by~$\Be$ --- in \tafkitv, they are both alphabets of characters or 
both alphabets of integers --- 
and the weight semiring (numerical, and commutative) by~$\K$ --- in 
\tafkitv, $\B$ or~$\Z$.
We denote the transducers by \Prm{tdc} rather than by \Prm{aut}.

As automata over~$\Ae\x\Be$, \code{fmp-transducers} are 
eligible to functions listed in \secti{aut-fct} and that apply to 
all automata.
For technical reasons, functions which involve reading rational 
expressions: \FctInd{cat-E},  
\FctInd{exp-to-aut}, are not implemented in \tafkitv.
On the other hand, a number of functions are specific to transducers, 
and are described in this section.

A transducer is \emph{subnormalized} if it is
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  \emph{proper};

    \item  weakly `letterized', \emph{in the sense} that the labels of 
transitions are either in $(A \x \unBe)$ or in $(\unAe \x B)$, or 
in~$(A\x B)$;

    \item  initial and final functions are \emph{scalar}, that is, take values in the weight semiring.
\end{enumerate}

\Comt 
The terminology `subnormalized' is new (introduced 
in~\cite{ClavEtAl05}) and comes from `normalized',
\index{subnormalized| see{transducer}}%
\index{transducer!subnormalized --}%
which means that the labels of 
transitions are either in $(A \x \unBe)$ or in $(\unAe \x B)$.
The terminology `normalized' is not so good, as it collides with the 
notion of normalized automata, but is widely accepted and used.
Once `normalized' is accepted, `subnormalized' is not so bad. 
Other suggestions are still welcome: no established 
terminology exists.

\Comt
The
\Fct{subnormalize} function is only a `decomposition' algorithm; it does not 
attempt to make the automaton more compact: this would be the task of 
other, and more sophisticated, algorithms.

\Exam
\figur{sbn} shows a $\Z$-transducer and its subnormalization.
Note that the transducer \code{fx1.xml} cannot be built, nor edited,

There are two distinct functions for the composition.
The first one, \Fct{composition}, yields a \fmpt in which the number

It is the only one which makes sense for \emph{weighted} \fmpt.
The second one, \Fct{b-composition}, is reserved for \emph{Boolean}

\label{fig:com-pos}
\end{figure}


\Cave
In \tafkitv, \Fct{b-composition} and \Fct{composition} do not test 
the precondition \Fct{is-subnormalized}.
In the case where this precondition is not met, the result is not 
correct.

This error will be corrected in subsequent versions.

\begin{SwClCmd}
\begin{shell}
$ \kbd{vcsn evaluation t.xml a.xml > b.xml}

\end{SwClCmd}%
\begin{SwClTxt}
    Computes an automaton which realizes the 
    image of the series realized by \Prm{a.xml} by the relation

    \Prm{b.xml}. 
\end{SwClTxt}%
\IndexFct{evaluation}


\Prec \Prm{t.xml} is subnormalized, \Prm{a.xml} is a realtime 
automaton over the input monoid of  \Prm{t.xml}, \Prm{t.xml} and 
\Prm{a.xml} have the same weight semiring.

\Spec
\Fctq{evaluation}{t.xml, a.xml} = 
\Fctq{W-image}{\Fctq{composition}{\Fctq{partial-identity}{a.xml},{t.xml}}}

\Comt
When the weight semiring is not \emph{complete}, it may be the case 
that the evaluation is not defined, in which case the call to 
\Fct{evaluation} will produce an error.

\end{shell}%
\end{SwClCmd}%
\begin{SwClTxt}
    Computes an automaton which realizes the 
    image of the expression \Prm{exp} by the relation 
    realized by \Prm{t.xml} and outputs the result as the expression 
    \Prm{fxp}. 
\end{SwClTxt}%
\IndexFct{eval}


\Prec \Prm{t.xml} is subnormalized, \Prm{exp} is an expression
 over the input monoid of \Prm{t.xml}.

% \Spec
% \Fctq{eval}{t.xml, w} = 
% \Fctq{evaluation}{t.xml, \Fctq{standard}{w}}

\Comt
Just a wrapper for \Fct{evaluation}.

\Cave
In \tafkitv, the expressions \Prm{exp} and \Prm{fxp} have to be under 
the string format: the \ShortOpt{i} and \ShortOpt{o} options have no effect 
on this function.
