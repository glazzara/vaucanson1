Compilation Problems
====================

I have a "NAN undeclared" error. What can I do?
-----------------------------------------------

Your C++ compiler does not  support the C99 standard library.  This is
a  known bug  (``NAN`` should  not be  used without  checking  for its
existence  before)  and will  be  corrected.   Meanwhile, use  another
compiler, such as the `GNU Compiler Collection`_ version 3.3 or above.

I have a conflit declaration for ``int getopt()``.
--------------------------------------------------

The   flag   ``HAVE_DECL_GETOPT``    must   be   set.   Compile   with
``-DHAVE_DECL_GETOPT``.    To   use   this   flag  with   the   script
``configure``, call it with::

   configure CPPFLAGS='-DHAVE_DECL_GETOPT'

Usage issues
============

How can I choose a specific graph implementation?
-------------------------------------------------

Use ``configure``'s ``--with-default-graph-impl`` option to control
the default graph implementation of the library.  The default is
``bmig`` (a graph represented using Boost Multi Indexes), the other
choice is ``listg`` (a graph represented using adjacency lists).  For
instance if you want to compile Vaucanson using ``listg`` by default,
use::

  ./configure --with-default-graph-impl=listg

The Vaucanson libraries will be compiled with this default
implementation, but if you do not use these libraries you can switch
the default graph implementation at any time using the
``VCSN_DEFAULT_GRAPH_IMPL`` preprocessor macro, for instance::

  make CPPFLAGS=-DVCSN_DEFAULT_GRAPH_IMPL=listg myprogram
