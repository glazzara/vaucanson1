Overview
========

Firstly  initiated by  Jacques  Sakarovitch in  2000,  Vaucanson is  a
project   developed   by    the   Ecole   Nationale   Supérieure   des
Télécommunications  [1]   and  the  EPITA   Research  and  Development
Laboratory (LRDE) [2].

The goal of this library is  to enable the development of C++ programs
in  an abstract  and  general way  with,  at the  same  time, a  large
specialization power. Indeed, on the one hand, we can write algorithms
working on  every automaton with  weights over any semirings  and with
words  from any  free monoids.  And on  the other  hand,  a particular
algorithm  can   be  specialized  for  a   particular  data  structure
implementing only a pseudo behaviour.

Yet,   Vaucanson  is  an   ongoing  development   project.   Therefore
algorithms,  data  structures and  the  general  architecture are  not
totally stable and well tested.

and bug reports to ``vaucanson-bugs@lrde.epita.fr``.


Installation
============

Complete installation procedure can be found in ``doc/INSTALL.txt``.

Here is a quick way to install Vaucanson. Type in this sequence at the
command prompt:

	./configure
	make sanity-check
	make install (as root)

This installation  requires 220  Mo of free  space and takes  about 30
minutes on a modern computer.

Note that an installation is  specific to the compiler used to install
it. Indeed, the call  to ``./configure`` enables some workarounds and,
consequently,  users must  compile  with the  same  compiler to  avoid
compatibility problems.


Using Vaucanson
===============

We are sorry but we do not provide a documentation of Vaucanson.

However Vaucanson comes with several  demos. Looking at them is a good
way to see what Vaucanson can do and how it works.  Those demos can be
found in the ``src/demos`` directory.

There are other sources of interest in the distribution.

- Headline news about the project can be found in the file ``NEWS`` at
  the root of the source tree.

- Documentation  about the  XML  I/O  subsystem can  be  found in  the
  ``doc/xml`` subdirectory.

- The library  reference manual, generated by Doxygen_,  is located in
  ``doc/ref``. It comes distributed as an archive of HTML files called
  ``ref.tar.gz``.

- Information about  the test suite generation mechanism  can be found
  in the file ``src/tests/test-suites/README``.
