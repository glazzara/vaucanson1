Vaucanson_, a C++ generic library for weighted finite state machine.

Overview
========

Firstly  initiated by  Jacques  Sakarovitch in  2000,  Vaucanson is  a
project   developed   by   the   Ecole   Nationale   Supérieure   des
Télécommunications [1] and the EPITA Research and Development Laboratory
(LRDE) [2].

The goal of this library is  to enable the development of C++ programs
in  an abstract  and  general way  with,  at the  same  time, a  large
specialization power. Indeed, on the one hand, we can write algorithms
working on  every automaton with  weights over any semirings  and with
words  from any  free monoids.  And on  the other  hand,  a particular
algorithm  can   be  specialized  for  a   particular  data  structure
implementing only a pseudo behaviour.

Yet,   Vaucanson  is  an   ongoing  development   project.   Therefore
algorithms,  data  structures and  the  general  architecture are  not
totally stable and well tested.

In the  ``doc/help`` directory,  you can find  a short howto  to start
programming  with Vaucanson.  The ``src``  directory  contains several
demonstrations,     but     you    can     also     look    at     the
``include/vaucanson/algorithms``  to be  introduced to  the  basics of
Vaucanson.

Please send  any question or  comments to ``vaucanson@lrde.epita.fr``,
and bug reports to ``vaucanson-bugs@lrde.epita.fr``.

Installation

There are other sources of interest in the distribution.

- Headline news about the project can be found in the file ``NEWS`` at
  the root of the source tree.

- Documentation  about the  XML  I/O  subsystem can  be  found in  the
  ``doc/xml`` subdirectory.

- The library  reference manual, generated by Doxygen_,  is located in
  ``doc/ref``. It comes distributed as an archive of HTML files called
  ``ref.tar.gz``.

- Information about  the test suite generation mechanism  can be found
  in the file ``src/tests/test-suites/README``.

- There   are  some  demonstration   programs  distributed   with  the
  project.  See  the ``src/demos``  subdirectory.  Some  of these  are
  noteworthy:

  - Usage   examples  in   subdirectories   ``src/demos/samples``  and
    ``src/demos/xml/samples``.

  - Vaucanson-FSM (``src/demos/fsm/README.txt``) is aimed at providing
    an emulation of the FSM toolbox [3].

  - Vaucanswig  (``src/demos/vaucanswig/doc/README.txt``) is  aimed at
    providing a dynamic language interpreter to the Vaucanson library.
