* Vaucanson 0.5
* -------------

** New XML Input/Output system.

** Better documentation.

An effort has been made to make the Doxygen documentation look better.
The  documentation  is  still  incomplete, and  some  errors  probably
remain, but it should be far more usable now.

Especially, the "Algorithm" section of the documentation should now be
exhaustive.

** Instantiation of Element which set is dynamic may fail when you do
** not specify the set.

  To  get more  safety at  runtime, trying  to instantiate  an Element
which set is dynamic without initializing the set will fail at compile
time.   This  ensures  every  Element  you  will  manipulate  has  its
corresponding set associated. This has two consequences:

  - Using Element::set() should provoke no more segmentation faults or
    similar undesired behavior.

  - The bound()  method has  no sense anymore  and therefore  has been
    removed.  If you make calls  to this method in your programs, just
    consider it returns true every time now and remove the call.

** Many renamings.

  To   get  a   more  consistent   interface,  a   few   methods  have
changed. Consequently,  your old code  designed for Vaucanson  0.4 may
not work  properly with Vaucanson  0.5. However, converting it  to the
new nomenclature should be straightforward:

  - All  names  containing  the  word  "serie" are  now  written  with
    "series" instead.  For example, serie_get() is now series_get().

  - All serie_t typedefs are now series_elt_t.

  - The method  value_get() for the  elements of series is  now called
    get().

  - The method  value_set() for the  elements of series is  now called
    assoc().

  - The  convenience  files  vaucanson_*.hh in  the  include/vaucanson
    directory have been stripped from their leading "vaucanson_".

  - hopcroft_minimization.hh is  now named minimization_hopcroft.hh to
    be consistent with minimization_moore.hh.

** New implementation for numerical semirings.

   It is now possible to use rational numbers as an implementation in
numerical semirings. In order to do so, the header
<vaucanson/algebra/concrete/semiring/rational_number.hh> must be included.
All you need to do then, is to declare a variable as follows:

    vcsn::Element<semiring_t, vcsn::algebra::RationalNumber> q(num, denom);

semiring_t can be any numerical semiring.

The usual operators have been  overloaded, and you can get the integer
or double value of the  fraction by using to_int() or to_double(). You
can also access the numerator with num() and denominator with denom().

** Many more tests.

  The test suite has been extended and improved. Generic tests are now
instantiated  on many  more  types.  Also,  existing  tests have  been
enriched with  extra checks and non-existing tests  have been written.
Some   bugs  have  been   discovered,  fixed,   and  now   have  their
corresponding regression test.

  As a result, running "make check" should take more time than before,
but now trusting  a successful check sequence is  less hazardous. Note
that it is  still possible to disable some tests  by removing the test
directory and running the configure script again.

  Tests have  shown that using some rational  expressions which weight
are  implemented  with  double  can  be  potentially  dangerous.  This
requires more  checks before  we can  fix it.  For  the moment  try to
avoid doing that.

** Rewriting of the minimization_moore() algorithm.

  The  minimization  algorithm  named  minimization_moore()  has  been
rewritten. It should be more readable and more reliable now.
