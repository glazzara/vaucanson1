* Vaucanson 0.5

** New implementation for numerical semiring.
** -----------------------------------------

   It is now possible to use rational numbers as an implementation in
numerical semirings. In order to do so, the header
<vaucanson/algebra/concrete/semiring/rational_number.hh> must be included.
All you need to do then, is to declare a variable as follows:

    vcsn::Element<semiring_t, vcsn::algebra::RationalNumber> q(num, denom);

semiring_t can be any numerical semiring.

The usual operators have been  overloaded, and you can get the integer
or double value of the  fraction by using to_int() or to_double(). You
can also access the numerator with num() and denominator with denom().

* Vaucanson 0.4

	* Addition of automata I/O subsystem.
	* Nearly-complete SWIG bindings for algorithms in Vaucanswig.
	* Preliminary documentation for Vaucanswig.
	* Addition of a Bitset class which behave almost like a std::set<int>.
	* Addition of a Window class to permit easy text manipulation.
	* Addition of a generic search algorithm able to skip characters in
	  the input stream.

	* More documentation efforts.
	* Addition of SWIG modules (Vaucanswig).
	* Noticeable performance boost thanks to a working unification
	of references to structural elements.
