To do:

  - Add more system info (e.g. hostname)
  - Fix date in xml output (\n)

  - Write proper XSD file, adapt XML output.

  ~ Allow bench loops:
      CBS works with vcsn's global bencher.

  ~ Support Windows & Mac:
      Write windows & mac versions of the timing primitives.

  ~ Consider changing memory probe to sbrk(0) again.

vcsn:
  - Gather xml files:
      Keep the directories as they are in make bench?

  - Plot algorithms together between versions (bars)
      Use one version as reference?

  - Generate html:
      Probably not necessary.
