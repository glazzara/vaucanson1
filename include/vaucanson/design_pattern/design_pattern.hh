/** @addtogroup design_pattern Fundamental C++: the Element design pattern.
 *
 * Core constructs for Vaucanson.
 *
 * This module contains definitions for the design pattern used in
 * Vaucanson, so called "Element". This design pattern is more deeply
 * described in the paper by Yann Régis-Gianas and Raphaël Poss:
 * <em>On orthogonal specialization in C++: Dealing with efficiency
 * and algebraic abstraction in Vaucanson</em>. In the proceedings of
 * the Parallel/High-performance Object-Oriented Scientific Computing
 * (POOSC'2003) Darmstadt, Germany July 2003.
