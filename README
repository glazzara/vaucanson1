OVERVIEW

Vaucanson, a C++ generic library for weighted finite state machine.

Firstly  initiated by   Jacques Sakarovitch  in  2000, Vaucanson  is a
project    developed   by  the     Ecole Nationale     Supérieure  des
Télécommunications and the EPITA  Research and Development  Laboratory
(LRDE).

The goal of this library is to enable  the development of C++ programs
in  an abstract  and general  way  with,  at  the  same time, a  large
specialization power. Indeed, on the one hand, we can write algorithms
working on every  automaton with weights over  any  semirings and with
words from any   free monoids. And  on  the other hand,  a  particular
algorithm  can    be specialized for     a particular  data  structure
implementing only a pseudo behaviour.

Yet,  Vaucanson is still  in   a  fundamental  development  phase  and
algorithms, data structures  and global  architecture are not  totally
stable and  well tested.  The   src directory will  be  extended  with
demonstration programs   soon. For the  moment, you   can look  at the
include/vaucanson/algorithms  to  be  introduced  to  the  basics   of
Vaucanson.

INSTALL

To install Vaucanson on your system, type the classical sequence :

	./configure
	make check
	make install (as root)

Notice that an installation is  done for  a particular compiler  since
./configure  enables  some workarounds  and,  consequently, users must
compile   with the same compiler     to avoid compatibility problems.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIREMENTS

Vaucanson    was  only tested     with      g++-3.3 and ICC.     The
code is written  in respect to  the ISO standard   to permit a  higher
portability in the future.

Moreover, high  verbose mode of the testing  suites uses the  AT&T dot
format to  save automaton  in a human  readable file.  Use Graphviz to
visualize these .dot files.
