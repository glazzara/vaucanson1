OVERVIEW

Vaucanson, a C++ generic library for weighted finite state machine.

Firstly  initiated by   Jacques Sakarovitch  in  2000, Vaucanson  is a
project    developed   by  the     Ecole Nationale     Supérieure  des
Télécommunications and the EPITA  Research and Development  Laboratory
(LRDE).

The goal of this library is to enable  the development of C++ programs
in  an abstract  and general  way  with,  at  the  same time, a  large
specialization power. Indeed, on the one hand, we can write algorithms
working on every  automaton with weights over  any  semirings and with
words from any   free monoids. And  on  the other hand,  a  particular
algorithm  can    be specialized for     a particular  data  structure
implementing only a pseudo behaviour.

Yet, Vaucanson is still in a fundamental development phase and
algorithms, data structures and global architecture are not totally
stable and well tested.  In the doc/help directory, you can find a
short howto to start programming with Vaucanson. The src directory
contains several demonstrations but you can also look at the
include/vaucanson/algorithms to be introduced to the basics of
Vaucanson.

INSTALL

To install Vaucanson on your system, type the classical sequence :

	./configure
	make check
	make install (as root)

Notice that an installation is  done for  a particular compiler  since
./configure  enables  some workarounds  and,  consequently, users must
compile   with the same compiler     to avoid compatibility problems.

If you want to use the interpreter whose compilation takes
a couple of hours, use instead:

	./configure --enable-vaucanswig

If you do not want to use  the XML I/O system, run:

	./configure --disable-xml

Use CXXFLAGS_DEBUG or CXXFLAGS_OPTIMIZE  to pass debug or optimization
flags,  not CXXFLAGS.   This is  because Vaucanson  tries to  use some
particular default flags  with some specific compilers such  as GCC or
ICC.    Using   CXXFLAGS   conflicts   with  those   specific   flags;
CXXFLAGS_DEBUG and CXXFLAGS_OPTIMIZE override these default flags.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIREMENTS

Vaucanson was  tested with g++ 3.[234],  and shoud work  with ICC 8.1.
The code is written in respect  to the ISO standard to permit a higher
portability in the future.

Moreover, high  verbose mode of the testing  suites uses the  AT&T dot
format to  save automaton  in a human  readable file.  Use Graphviz to
visualize these .dot files.

If you want to use the XML I/O system, you will need the Apache Xerces
C++ library version 2.3.*. You will find it here:
